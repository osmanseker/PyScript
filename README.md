# PyScript number guesser

The given code is an HTML document that includes styling with CSS and a Python script written in Pyscript, a JavaScript-like language that compiles to Python bytecode, embedded within the HTML file using the Pyodide library.

The page provides a simple number guessing game, where the user has to guess a random number between 1 and 10. The number of guesses taken to reach the correct answer is displayed. The user can restart the game or make a guess using the corresponding buttons.

The Python script generates a random number and handles the game's logic, updating the number of guesses and providing feedback to the user after each guess. The Pyodide library is used to interface with the Python script from the HTML file.
